Many of us are aware with the concept of leaving traces whenever we visit a new place, so that we do not get lost and can return back easily. The most famous fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel is the best example of this concept. In this fairy tale, both the siblings would leave bread pieces and formed a path which they can follow and get back to their home easily.

Interestingly, the Hansel and Gretel fairytale inspired the term breadcrumbs, which provides a path that will guide the users about their exact location and the path of reaching back home.

That was a lot of interesting information to get into few words, but no eCommerce store owner can deny the fact that they are always concerned with the most minor factors that can be used in increasing their store traffic, revenue and conversion rates. The concept of breadcrumbs might seem so minor for you, but it will have a major impact on your website.

Whenever a customer visits the eCommerce store, a set of links will guide them through the website/product pages and this set of links is called breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs can easily assist the customers to reach previous pages quickly. MageComp’s Magento 2 Breadcrumbs Module will help your website display the breadcrumbs on various pages.
